# anime-offline-database
The purpose of this *.json file is to create an offline database containing anime meta data aggregated by different anime source pages. This file is supposed to be used by manami.

**The goal is to deliver at least weekly updates.**

## Content
This database is limited to a certain type of anime. Anime which match the following criteria are to be **excluded**:
+ commercials/promotions
+ stop motion productions
+ music videos
+ pure CG productions
+ abstract animations
+ unrelated shorts
+ any non-japanese productions (korean, chinese, american...)
+ anime before 1970

## Participation
If you find anything that you think should be changed, please file an issue rather than creating a pull request.

## Structure
This repository contains three files. The database file itself and two files for regulation. One file with IDs which have been excluded from the database as well as a file with IDs from the distributor sites result in 404 not found.
