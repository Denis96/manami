## What does it do?
Manami let's you create an index file for the animes that you already watched and stored on your hard drive. Additionally based on this list you can search for related animes and recommendations.

### All features at a glance
* Import entries from MAL
* Automatically fill out meta information upon adding a new entry
* Creates an index list for your local animes which can be opened in your browser
* Import/Export from/to CSV/JSON
    * The basic file format is XML
* Automatic recommendation search
* Automatic related anime finder
* Automatically check your list for inconsistency
* Use a filter list to narrow your search results down
* Use a watch list with animes you are currently watching or you plan to watch
* No need to provide username or password
* No installer, it's just portable

### Why?
Manami is not meant to be an alternative to MAL. It should be seen as an extension. It provides an index list for you local animes and features that I personally missed on MAL which have never been implemented.
